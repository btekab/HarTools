This is a small command-line application written in Java for converting HAR (HTTP Archive) files to CSV (comma separated values). It’s useful for importing web pages statistics, from a browser extension to a spreadsheet, in order to do some analysis on sizes and timings.

As all Java applications, it’s cross-platform. All you need is a JRE (Java runtime environment) properly installed. I added two executable wrappers, one for Windows systems (har2csv.exe) and a Bash script for Linux boxes (har2csv).
